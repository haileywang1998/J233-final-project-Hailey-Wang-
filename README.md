I have split the project into two parts: one for cleaning data and another for analysis.

For the data cleaning part, you will find the Python file named "J233 final project_data cleaning.ipynb." 
Download the datasets "raw_data.csv" and "new income county.csv" to rerun the cells.

Moving on to the analysis part, you will use the Python file named "final project analysis.ipynb." 
To rerun the cells, download the datasets "cleaned cdc places with python.csv," "combine_depression_income with python.csv," and "county_map.geojson."

I have also uploaded the three maps I created, named "asthma 2.svg," "heartdisease 2.svg," and "smoking 2.svg."
